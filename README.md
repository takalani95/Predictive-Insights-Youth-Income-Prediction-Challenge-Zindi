# Predictive-Insights-Youth-Income-Prediction-Challenge-Zindi

## Introduction
This is a step by step approach to the Predictive Insights competition.

Youth unemployment and under-employment is a major concern for any developing country, and serves as an important predictor of economic health and prosperity. Being able to predict, and understand, which young people will find employment and which ones will require additional help, helps promote evidence-based decision-making, supports economic empowerment, and allows young people to thrive in their chosen careers.

The objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts youth employment, based on data from labour market surveys in South Africa.

This solution will help organisations like Predictive Insights achieve a baseline prediction of young peoples’ employment outcomes, allowing them to design and test interventions to help youth make a transition into the labour market or to improve their earnings.

## The Data
The data for this challenge comes from four rounds of a survey of youth in the South African labour market, conducted at 6-month intervals. The survey contains numerical, categorical and free-form text responses. You will also receive additional demographic information such as age and information about school level and results.

Each person in the dataset was surveyed one year prior (the ‘baseline’ data) to the follow-up survey. We are interested in predicting whether a person is employed at the follow-up survey based on their labour market status and other characteristics during the baseline.

The training set consists of one row or observation per individual - information collected at baseline plus only the target outcome (whether they were employed or not) one year later. The test set consists of the data collected at baseline without the target outcome.

The objective of this challenge is to predict whether a young person will be employed, one year after the baseline survey, based on their demographic characteristics, previous and current labour market experience and education outcomes, and to deliver an easy-to-understand and insightful solution to the data team at Predictive Insights.
