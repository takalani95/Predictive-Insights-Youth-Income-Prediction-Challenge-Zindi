# Predictive-Insights-Youth-Income-Prediction-Challenge-Zindi

## Introduction
This is a step by step approach to the Predictive Insights competition.

Youth unemployment and under-employment is a major concern for any developing country, and serves as an important predictor of economic health and prosperity. Being able to predict, and understand, which young people will find employment and which ones will require additional help, helps promote evidence-based decision-making, supports economic empowerment, and allows young people to thrive in their chosen careers.

The objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts youth employment, based on data from labour market surveys in South Africa.

This solution will help organisations like Predictive Insights achieve a baseline prediction of young peoplesâ€™ employment outcomes, allowing them to design and test interventions to help youth make a transition into the labour market or to improve their earnings.
